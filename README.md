# HMR-Public

Greetings, this repository has been set up in support of the How Many Realizations paper.  If you are interested in rerunning the dataset see below "Rerun" section that goes through what order to run the notebooks in.  Otherwise if you are only interested in the outputs, please see the Supplemental_Figures_Charts folder.  Due to Github's size limits this folder contains a number of zip files <25 mb in size.  Each zip file contains PNG files for your viewing.

## Rerun
After installing the environment.yml file...

Note: Depending on computer resources certain steps may take anywhere from minutes to hours to days to run.  For example, Steps 2 and 3 will likely take many days to run.
